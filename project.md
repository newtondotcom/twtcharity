📌 To support us : simply like, retweet or answer to our tweet in order to generate traffics and increase our visibility.

📌 It takes you less than five seconds a day and could have a direct impact on the real world.

📌 Feel free to suggest names of NGOs in the comments of the daily posts that you would like to support and we will make a poll at the end of each month to choose the NGO that will be supported during the next month. 

📌 Our values are : 
- 🔎 transparency : we will be posting screenshots of our revenues and payments to NGOs each months as soon as we reach monetization. 
- 🙏hope : we want act to make the world a little bit better
- 📈 ambition : we wish we could federate as much people as possible to adhere to our project
